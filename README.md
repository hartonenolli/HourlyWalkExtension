## <a id="tldr"></a>TL;DR
This is my second hobby project. The purpose of this application is to remind Chrome users to take small exercise breaks. The target group is people who work on a computer using the Chrome browser.

When working, researching, studying, coding, or just browsing, an hour can go by quickly. It is important to take small breaks so that a person does not become overly stressed from staring at a screen and constantly sitting. Small moments of exercise improve well-being and stamina, and you feel more refreshed after the day.
