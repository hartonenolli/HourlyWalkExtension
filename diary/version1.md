## Thoughts and what I learned
I'm happy with how the project has progressed. I've never made an extension for Chrome before, so this was a completely new challenge for me.

I have noticed during the project that extensions have a lot of potential. The development was challenging at first, but there is a lot of information to be found to make the development possible.

I think this project has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to it.

Documenting and reviewing the status of this version phase helps to steer development in the right direction.
